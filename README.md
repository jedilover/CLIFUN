# CLIFUN
AWS CLI example for 9 year old based on AWS documentation

wanted to clarify to a passionate child, how with single script one can create( if not clean so easily )
stack similar to cf, cdk, terraform, without needing node, including inline policies
and with just actual lambda code with cat EOF

#depends on 
jq, aws cli -> python

#after that
export AWS_PROFILE=yours
